AgriSafe is a digital solution to monitor and manage antimicrobial usage (AMU) in livestock farming.
The platform helps farmers, veterinarians, and regulators ensure responsible drug use, reduce antimicrobial resistance (AMR) risks, and promote safe food production by tracking antimicrobial treatments, dosages, withdrawal periods, and compliance with Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs).
